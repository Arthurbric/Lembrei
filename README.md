# Limbrei 🧠✨

*A smart reminder app designed for people with ADHD — because remembering shouldn’t be harder than the task itself.*

## Overview

Limbrei is a **context-aware reminder application** that helps people with ADHD manage daily tasks.
Unlike traditional reminder apps, Limbrei uses **location-based triggers** to deliver reminders when and where they’re most useful.

For example:

* 🛒 At the market → *“Don’t forget to buy milk.”*
* 🏠 At home → *“Take out the trash before 8 PM.”*
* 🏫 At school/work → *“Submit the assignment today.”*

The goal is to reduce cognitive load and make life easier by reminding you at the right place and time.

## Features

✅ **Location-based reminders** – tasks pop up when you’re in the right spot.
✅ **Clean, distraction-free UI** – designed for ADHD-friendly focus.
✅ **Customizable tasks** – set your own reminders with notes and priorities.
✅ **Smart notifications** – delivered gently but persistently so they don’t get lost.
✅ **Cross-device sync** *(planned)* – access reminders on phone, tablet, or desktop.
